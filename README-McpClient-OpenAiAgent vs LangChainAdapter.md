# MCP Clients in OpenAI Agent SDK vs LangChain Adapter

## OpenAI Agent SDK vs LangChain Adapter as MCP Clients

✅ **both *can* function as an MCP client in the broad sense — but there’s a big difference in how directly they do it.**

---

### ✅ What Does “MCP Client” Mean?

From an architectural perspective, an **MCP Client** is:

> Any code that connects to an MCP Server, discovers its tools/resources, and makes calls to those tools.

So an MCP client does two things:

1. **Tool Discovery**
   → fetch list of tools, schemas, parameters from MCP server.

2. **Tool Invocation**
   → send input data to MCP server’s tool endpoints and get the results back.

---

### ✅ LangChain Adapter → **Native MCP Client**

✅ **LangChain MCP Adapter is a direct MCP client.**

* Connects directly to MCP servers via the MCP protocol.
* Handles tool discovery automatically.
* Converts MCP tools → LangChain tools.
* Calls MCP tools transparently from LangChain chains/agents.

So:

```
LangChain Adapter
      ↓
MCP Server
```

✅ **It is truly an MCP client.**

---

### ✅ OpenAI Agent SDK + MCP Tools → **Indirect MCP Client**

Now for OpenAI’s Agent SDK:

❌ **It’s NOT natively an MCP client.**

* The Agent SDK has no built-in concept of:

  * MCP servers
  * the MCP protocol
  * tool **discovery** from MCP servers

✅ **But… you can build a bridge.**

* You can write code that:

  * queries the MCP server for its tool list.
  * registers those tools as JSON function definitions for OpenAI.
  * creates HTTP endpoints that execute MCP tools when OpenAI calls them.

So in that scenario, you’re **manually** creating an MCP client layer.

### ✅ Architecture Diagram

If you integrate MCP with the OpenAI Agent SDK:

```
OpenAI Agent SDK
      ↓ calls
Your API endpoints
      ↓
MCP SDK / LangChain Adapter
      ↓
MCP Server
```

---

### ✅ So Technically…

* **LangChain Adapter → true MCP client.**
* **OpenAI Agent SDK → can *function* as an MCP client *if you build the glue code.***

So the OpenAI Agent SDK + manipulated tools **can act as an MCP client indirectly.** But:

→ It’s **not a direct MCP client by itself.**
→ You **must implement the client logic** for talking to the MCP server.

---

# ✅ Summary

✅ **LangChain MCP Adapter → direct MCP client**

* connects directly to MCP servers
* automatic tool discovery + invocation

✅ **OpenAI Agent SDK → not an MCP client by default**

* needs manual integration
* you must code:

  * tool discovery
  * HTTP bridges to call MCP servers
